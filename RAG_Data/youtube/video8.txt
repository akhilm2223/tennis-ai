Self-doubt in athletes: How to overcome self-doubt with mental game coaching
Eli Straw

don't normally feel that self-doubt if
you're just going and practicing by
yourself or maybe with your close
friends
self-doubt is one of those things that
can be so frustrating because you often
don't understand why do you have it in
the first place so before we go into how
you can overcome self-doubt let's dive
into where does the self-doubt come from
in the first place the main reason
you're going to struggle with self-doubt
as an athlete has to do with low
confidence
they're pretty much one in the same
where if you're doubting yourself you're
not going to be very confident if you're
not confident you're going to adopt
yourself but in addition to this there
are a few key areas that we can point to
to where if you're focusing on these
things that's going to lead to even more
self-doubt or if you've been
experiencing this that can also
contribute to self-doubt number one is
going to be outcome oriented thinking as
an athlete
it's very natural to want to think about
the outcome the outcome being the score
of the game the outcome being your stats
at the end of the year the outcome even
being what somebody else is going to
think of you
but when you focus too much on the
outcome this can drive fear this can
drive anxiety and it can also lead to
self-doubt when you're thinking too much
about the outcome and you're worried
about how am I going to perform that
opens a door to you wondering am I going
to perform well and when you wonder am I
going to perform well that's going to
increase self-doubt another thing that
can increase self-doubt is performance
anxiety I just said performance anxiety
is caused a lot by outcome oriented
thinking when you're struggling with
this anxiety going into performances
your mind is thinking about what's going
to happen I hope this doesn't happen I
hope this does happen
when you have all those kinds of hopes
and worries in your mind that can also
lead to self-doubt a third reason that
you may be struggling with self-doubt
has to do with something more physical
or at least something more based in past
performances and that is having a lot of
bad games recently if you've been
struggling in your performances and for
the past two weeks or even just the past
couple of games you haven't been
performing as well
that's going to lead to self-doubt going
into the next game because if you aren't
seeing yourself succeed physically
you're not likely going to have as much
confidence going into the next game this
can even be taken on a smaller scale to
where if you are a tennis player for
example and you've lost a few games in a
row or you've even just lost a few
points in a row that can lead to
self-doubt because what's most recently
on your mind is you're not doing well
therefore you're going to adopt yourself
moving forward and a fourth reason that
you might be struggling with self-doubt
has to do with perfectionism more
specifically it has to do with the way
that you evaluate yourself when you're a
perfectionist you likely evaluate
yourself by looking at all the things
you did wrong now this is coming from a
place of Desiring Improvement you're
looking at everything you did wrong
thinking okay that's how I'm going to
get better but this also has the
negative effect of causing self-doubt if
after every practice or after every game
all you're doing is going and finding
the things you did wrong
well after doing that for a while what
is your mindful of your mind's full of
things you did wrong and I just said
that when you have bad performances back
to back to back that causes self-doubt
because the most recent thing on your
mind is you're performing badly well if
all you're finding after a performance
is something you did wrong well then
what's on your mind
what you did wrong and that's going to
lead to self-doubt because you're
focused on what you did wrong rather
than focusing on the things that you did
right and then asking yourself where you
can improve but doing it in a more
healthy way that's actually going to
lead to growth within your sport to
overcome self-doubt we need to work on
building confidence so what I'm going to
do now is give you three different
exercises that you can use to work on
building confidence as an athlete
exercise number one is self-talk if you
change the way that you speak to
yourself and you change the way that you
think that's going to increase
confidence and that's going to reduce
self-doubt what you want to do is list
out all the negative beliefs you have
all the negative things you say to
yourself then write some positive
Alternatives begin repeating those
positive alternatives to yourself on a
daily basis whenever you're at practice
or whenever you're playing a game repeat
those positive phrases to yourself when
you speak to yourself more confidently
you're not going to doubt yourself as
much an example is
I don't know if I can do this
instead of saying that say I can do this
I trust in my training I know that I'm a
great player
tool number two is visualization
building the memory of success is key to
improving confidence which equally is
key to overcoming self-doubt
visualization is the act of rehearsing
in your mind you performing your sport
so let's say that you are a football
player for example and you're really
doubting yourself right now with
catching passes well what you can do is
you can visualize yourself running
routes and catching passes
all you have to do for visualization is
think what parts of my game right now am
I doubting myself the most in and then
take those
and in the safety of your mind when
you're in your room or maybe you're in
the locker room your living room
wherever
close your eyes take a few deep breaths
to relax and then visualize yourself
performing well you do this over and
over again that's going to work to
increase that memory of success and
reduce your self-doubt tool number three
is to change the way that you are
evaluating your performances this is a
simple two question exercise that you
can use after every practice every game
and you can even use it on a smaller
scale I recommended athletes I've worked
with to use this between plays even
because it needs to be used on a
consistent basis to reframe the way that
you're seeing your performances the
questions are these
what did I do well
where can I improve
just like that and in that order more
specifically
what did I do well where can I improve I
promise you can have the worst game of
your life there's still something you
did well even if it's the tiniest little
thing and you've really got to dig to
find it you can find something you did
well the reason it's important to first
ask yourself what did I do well is that
is going to give you a more positive
mindset it's allowing you to see
successes which increases your
confidence then it puts you in a best
frame of mind to then look at where can
I improve not what did I do wrong why
did I have such a crappy game none of
that it's where can I improve if your
goal is to continually get better and
better and better you don't need to be
beating yourself up you need to be
effectively using your mistakes for
improvement learning from them putting
those lessons into action and practice
and then getting better in your
performances so use those three tools
the self-talk the visualization the two
question self-analysis exercise and put
that into practice and that will help to
reduce your self-doubt as an athlete
