January 5, 2025

Off-season just ended. Back on the court full time. My arm feels rusty, and my footwork is a step slow. Coach says it's normal, but the pressure is already mounting. First tournament is next month. Every time I miss a first serve in practice, I feel this knot in my stomach. It’s just practice, but it feels like a final. I need to get my head right. The anxiety is already creeping in, whispering that I haven't done enough, that I'm not good enough for the circuit this year.

January 12, 2025

This week was brutal. Drills, drills, and more drills. My shoulder is aching, but it's the mental fatigue that's really killing me. We worked on tie-breakers, and I lost five in a row. I could feel the frustration building until I just wanted to smash my racket. I held it in, but that feeling of failure... it's suffocating. I lay awake last night just replaying points, imagining all the ways I could lose. This stress is eating me alive, and the season hasn't even started.

January 19, 2025

Tried meditation this week. It was... okay. My mind kept racing back to my backhand, my weak qualifying draw last year, the prize money I need to earn. It’s hard to just "be present" when the present feels so overwhelming. Had a practice match and double-faulted on match point. It was just a practice, but my hands were shaking. How am I supposed to handle real pressure if I can't even handle this? Everyone else looks so calm, so ready. I just feel scared.

January 26, 2025

First tournament next week. The anxiety is palpable now. It's like a constant hum in the background. I'm checking the draw compulsively, even though it's not out. I’m over-analyzing my first-round opponent, whoever he might be. Packed my bags today and had to repack three times because I was convinced I forgot something vital. My sleep is terrible. Woke up in a cold sweat thinking I’d missed my match time. I just want to play well, but my fear of playing poorly is paralyzing.

February 2, 2025

Flew in yesterday. The hotel room feels small, suffocating. First-round match is tomorrow against a qualifier I don't know. That's almost worse. The unknown. My stomach is in knots. I could barely eat dinner. Went to the site to hit, and my timing was completely off. The balls felt like rocks. My strings feel too tight, then too loose. Everything feels wrong. I just want to hide, but instead, I have to go out in front of people and perform. The dread is overwhelming.

February 9, 2025

Lost. First round. 6-2, 6-4. It wasn't even close. I played tight, scared. My feet were cemented to the court. Every time I went for a shot, my arm would seize up. The anxiety won. Now I have to sit with this for a week until the next tournament. The flight to the next city was silent. I just stared out the window, feeling like a complete failure. All that training, all that stress, for this. What's the point if I can't conquer this feeling on the court?

February 16, 2025

Second tournament. At least I'm in a new city. But the same feelings are here. I'm practicing, but it's mechanical. I'm not feeling the ball. I'm just going through the motions, dreading my next match. I saw some of the other players laughing, relaxed. How do they do that? I feel like I'm carrying a 100-pound weight on my shoulders. The stress isn't just about winning; it's about not embarrassing myself, not letting my coach down, not proving all my doubts right.

February 23, 2025

Won a match. A horrible, ugly, three-set grind. 7-6, 5-7, 6-4. I should be happy, but I just feel... relieved. And exhausted. I didn't play well. I just played less-badly than the other guy. My nerves were shot the entire time. I double-faulted 14 times. Fourteen. I can't win like that consistently. My next round is against the 3rd seed. I'm already stressed about the beating I'm probably going to take. There's no joy in this right now, just survival.

March 2, 2025

Got destroyed. 6-1, 6-1. As expected. The guy was just better, but I didn't even make him work for it. I was defensive, passive, and slow. The gap between me and the top guys feels like a canyon. Coach tried to be positive, "good week, you won a round," but I can see the disappointment. Or maybe I'm just projecting. The self-doubt is deafening. Maybe I've hit my ceiling. Maybe this is as good as I'll ever be, and it's just not good enough.

March 9, 2025

Home for a few days before the next swing. It's almost harder being here. Everyone asks, "How was it? How'd you do?" I have to put on a brave face, "It was tough, good competition." I can't tell them I felt sick with anxiety and played like a coward. I feel like a fraud. I'm supposed to be this rising athlete, but I just feel like a scared kid. The pressure to live up to their expectations is suffocating. I just want to sleep.

March 16, 2025

Back on the road. New tournament, same old anxiety. This time, it's my forehand. It's completely abandoned me in practice. I'm shanking balls left and right. Every time I swing, I'm terrified it's going into the back fence. It's a technical issue, I'm sure, but my mind is making it a catastrophe. I'm trying to trust the process, trust my coach, but the stress is making me irritable and defensive. I snapped at my hitting partner today. Felt terrible afterward.

March 23, 2025

It's raining. All matches cancelled. You'd think I'd be relieved, but it's worse. Now I'm stuck in the hotel room with my thoughts. Just me and my anxiety, replaying every bad point, every missed opportunity. I'm worried about the schedule change, playing two matches in one day. My body is already tired. My mind is exhausted. I'm trying to read a book, watch a movie, anything to escape, but the stress of the upcoming match just looms over everything.

March 30, 2025

Pulled out a win. Another grinder. But I felt something click. I was down 2-5 in the third, and the anxiety was so bad I thought I'd throw up. Then, suddenly, it was like I didn't care anymore. The fear of losing was replaced by a kind of numb anger. I just started hitting out, and the ball started going in. It's not a healthy way to play, and I can't rely on it, but it got me the win. Now I'm just drained. Physically and emotionally empty.

April 6, 2025

Lost in the quarters. Played the 3rd seed again, but this time I competed. Lost 6-4, 7-5. I wasn't scared. I was just... outplayed. It's a strange feeling. I'm disappointed, but not devastated. The anxiety was still there, but it was a background noise, not a siren. Maybe that's progress? Or maybe it's just a temporary reprieve. Still, the stress of constant travel and pressure is weighing on me. I feel so far from home, so isolated in this.

April 13, 2025

Clay season. My least favorite surface. The ball bounces weird, the sliding messes with my footwork, and the points are long. My patience is already being tested. Practice was a disaster. I was covered in red dirt and self-pity. The stress just shifted. It's not about my forehand anymore; it's about the surface. It's always something. I feel like I'm just finding new things to be anxious about. Coach says I need to embrace the grind. Easy for him to say.

April 20, 2025

Another first-round loss. I just couldn't find my rhythm on the clay. The guy I played was a specialist. He just looped balls high to my backhand until I made an error. It was torture. I felt helpless. The anxiety wasn't the sharp, panicked kind; it was a slow, dull dread. I knew I was going to lose from the third game. That's the worst feeling. Flying to the next tournament, and I just want to go home. This is miserable.

April 27, 2025

Started working with a sports psychologist. We had our first session over video call. It was awkward. I talked about the pressure, the anxiety, the fear of failure. He listened. He gave me some breathing exercises. It feels... silly. Like, how is breathing supposed to help me return a 130mph serve? But I promised I'd try. I'm desperate. I can't keep letting my mind beat me before my opponent even gets a chance. The stress is too much.

May 4, 2025

Won my first-round match on clay. It wasn't pretty, but I used the breathing exercises. When I was serving for the match at 5-4, my heart was pounding. I stepped back, focused on my breath, and... I held. I actually held. It didn't make the anxiety disappear, but it made it manageable. It felt like I had a tool for the first time, instead of just white-knuckling it. I'm still stressed about my next round, but it's a start.

May 11, 2025

Lost, but I fought. That's what I'm clinging to. I wasn't passive. I went for my shots. My sports psych guy, Dr. Lee, talked about "process over outcome." He wants me to focus on my rituals, my footwork, my breathing... not on the scoreboard. It's so hard. Winning is the point. But I'm trying. The stress of qualifying for the French Open is mounting, and I'm not sure I can handle it. But... maybe I can.

May 18, 2025

French Open qualies. The atmosphere is different. Tense. Everyone here is desperate. You can smell it. My anxiety is through the roof. This is a Major. The pressure is immense. My first match is against a young French wildcard. He'll have the whole crowd. I'm already dreading the "allez." I spent all last night visualizing, trying to stay positive, but the negative thoughts are so loud. What if I choke? What if I'm just not good enough for this level?

May 25, 2025

I did it. I qualified. Three brutal matches. The last one was a 7-5 in the third. I'm in the main draw of a Slam. I cried. I just sat in my chair and cried. It wasn't even joy, just... release. All that stress, all that anxiety... it just poured out of me. I'm exhausted. My body is wrecked. And now I have to play a top-20 guy in the first round. I should be celebrating, but I'm just overwhelmed. But still. I did it.

June 1, 2025

Played on Court 14. Lost in straight sets. But I wasn't embarrassed. I held my own in some rallies. The guy was just on another level. The speed, the power. It was an education. The anxiety was there, but so was excitement. Walking through the gates of Roland Garros... it was a dream. Now I'm out, and the comedown is weird. All this build-up, all this stress, and it's over in two hours. Back to the grind.

June 8, 2025

Transitioning to grass. It's so fast. My timing is all off. The ball skids. My knees are aching from the low bounce. It's another surface to stress about. I feel like I'm constantly adjusting, constantly on edge. Had a panic attack in practice yesterday. Just... couldn't breathe. My chest got tight, hands went numb. Coach had to sit with me for 20 minutes. It was humiliating. This anxiety isn't just in my head; it's physical, and it's terrifying.

June 15, 2025

First grass tournament. Lost. Again. My confidence is shattered. That panic attack shook me. I'm playing tentatively, afraid to move, afraid to hit. I'm so worried about feeling that anxiety again that I'm creating it. It's a vicious cycle. Dr. Lee says to "accept" the anxiety. To treat it like a "guest." I don't want this guest. I want to kick it out. I'm so tired of feeling scared.

June 22, 2025

Wimbledon qualies. The pressure is back. The most famous tournament in the world. Even the qualifying is prestigious. I'm trying to just focus on the ball, the grass, my strings. But my mind keeps wandering. What if I fail again? What if I'm just a clay qualifier and a grass nobody? The stress is giving me headaches. I can't sleep more than a few hours. I'm surviving on coffee and adrenaline. This isn't healthy.

June 29, 2025

Lost. Final round of qualies. One match away. I was up a break in the third. And I choked. Plain and simple. Got tight, started pushing the ball. He didn't win; I lost. The disappointment is crushing. This one hurts more than the others. I was so close. The anxiety just picked the worst possible moment to paralyze me. I don't know how I come back from this. I let myself down. I let my team down.

July 6, 2025

Skipped the next tournament. Went home. I was burned out. Physically, but mostly mentally. The stress was unbearable. I just sat on my couch for three days. Didn't touch a racket. Dr. Lee said it was a good idea. "Strategic rest." I just feel like a quitter. But I know I couldn't have handled another match. I feel broken. Is this what the tour is? Just a constant cycle of stress, anxiety, and disappointment?

July 13, 2025

Back on the hard courts. The American swing. This is my surface. I should feel comfortable. But I feel rusty. That week off... I'm worried it killed my momentum. But what momentum? I'm just anxious about getting back out there. The fear of losing, the stress of competing. It all came rushing back the second I stepped on the court. My first match is in two days. I feel sick.

July 20, 2025

Won a round. A solid, 6-3, 6-4 win. I played... okay. I wasn't brilliant, but I was steady. The anxiety was there, but I managed it. I focused on my breathing, my rituals. "Process over outcome." It's starting to sink in. It's not about not feeling the anxiety; it's about playing anyway. It's a small victory, but god, I needed one. The stress of the past few weeks has been so heavy. This is a tiny bit of light.

July 27, 2025

Made it to a quarterfinal. A Challenger, but still. Decent points. Good matches. I'm starting to feel the ball again. But the stress is different now. It's not just "don't lose"; it's "you have to win." The pressure to back up the previous week's results. I'm defending points from last year. The financial stress is real. Every match I lose is money I don't earn. That anxiety is a whole different beast.

August 3, 2025

My body is breaking down. My left knee is throbbing. Physio says it's patellar tendonitis. "Rest," he says. How am I supposed to rest? It's the middle of the US Open swing. This is where I have to make my points, my money. The stress of injury is almost worse than the stress of losing. It feels so out of my control. I'm popping anti-inflammatories just to practice. This is a nightmare.

August 10, 2025

Playing with tape all over my knee. It hurts. Every serve, every change of direction. And I'm paranoid about it. I'm not trusting my movement, which means I'm late to the ball, which means I'm making errors. The anxiety of "is this the one? is this the shot that tears it?" is constant. I lost, obviously. But now I have a bigger problem. Do I keep playing and risk serious injury, or do I stop and watch my ranking plummet?

August 17, 2025

Decided to take two weeks off and rehab. Flying home. It feels like a defeat. I'm missing the biggest tournaments of the summer. The stress is suffocating. I'll be sitting at home, watching guys I know I can beat win matches, make money. I'm so angry. And scared. What if it doesn't get better? What if this is chronic? My career feels so fragile, like it could all be over in one bad step.

August 24, 2025

US Open qualies are next week. I'm not there. I'm in a physio office, doing boring exercises. My knee is slowly feeling better, but my mind is a mess. The anxiety of being left behind is intense. I'm checking scores constantly, which Dr. Lee told me not to do. I feel disconnected from my own life. This sport is all I am, and when I can't play... who am I? Just a guy with a bad knee and a lot of stress.

August 31, 2025

Watched the US Open on TV. It was torture. Every single player looked like a giant, a superhero. I felt so small, so insignificant. The rehab is going well, but it's slow. The anxiety is shifting. It's not "what if I lose?" It's "what if I can't even get back to the point where I can lose?" The stress of the comeback, the doubt... it's a heavy, dark cloud.

September 7, 2025

Cleared to play. A small tournament. Just to test the knee. I've never been so nervous for a match in my life. Not even the slam. The anxiety was purely physical. My heart was pounding out of my chest. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely grip the racket. I wasn't worried about winning. I was worried about my knee exploding. Every point was a test.

September 14, 2025

I won. The tournament. A small, futures-level event, but I won it. The knee held up. Five matches in six days. I'm exhausted, but the relief is... I can't even describe it. The anxiety was my shadow all week. But I managed. I played through the pain, through the fear. This... this feels different. It's not just a win. It's a resurrection. Still, the stress of "will it hold?" is going to be with me for a while.

September 21, 2025

Back at a Challenger. The level is higher. Lost second round. And I'm okay with it. The knee felt good. I competed well. The guy was just better on the day. The anxiety is still there, but it's not controlling me. We're... co-existing. Dr. Lee calls this "integration." I call it "hell." But it's a manageable hell. The stress of the ranking points is back, but the fear of my body failing is less. A trade-off.

September 28, 2025

Indoor season. Europe. The travel is a grind. Jet lag, different food, courts are fast. My shoulder is barking again. It's always something. The physical stress is relentless. And it feeds the mental stress. I'm tired, I'm sore, I'm lonely. This life looks glamorous from the outside, but right now, I'm just in a drab hotel room in Belgium, eating a protein bar for dinner, stressing about my first-round match against some guy I've never heard of.

October 5, 2025

Another week, another hotel, another early-round loss. I feel like I'm treading water. My ranking isn't moving. I'm not making money. The anxiety is morphing into depression. A dull, heavy, "what's the point" feeling. I'm calling my family less. I'm isolating myself. Coach is worried. I'm worried. But I don't know how to fix it. The stress is just... normal now. It's my baseline.

October 12, 2025

Had a long talk with Dr. Lee. He said I'm showing signs of burnout. He's right. I have no motivation. Getting out of bed to practice feels impossible. The joy is gone. It's just a stressful, painful job. We talked about finding "value" outside of winning. I'm trying. I'm exploring the cities I'm in, for an hour at least. Trying to read non-tennis books. It's... something. But the anxiety of not training 100% is, of course, stressful.

October 19, 2025

Played a match today. Lost. But I tried something new. I focused on one thing. My serve. Just hitting my spots, good rhythm. Nothing else. Not the score, not my opponent, not the ranking points. Just the serve. I lost 6-4, 6-4, but I served at 68%. It's the first time in a long time I walked off court feeling... not terrible. The stress was still there, but my focus was sharper. Maybe this is a new tool.

October 26, 2025

I'm tired. So, so tired. The season is almost over. Just a couple more tournaments. Everyone is playing on fumes. Tempers are short. Bodies are broken. My anxiety is just a dull ache now. The stress is a familiar blanket. I'm not even fighting it anymore. I'm just... enduring. I want to go home, but I need the points. I need the money. So I'll drag myself to the next city and do it all again.

November 2, 2025

Last tournament of the year. I'm in the main draw. Just barely. I feel a strange sense of calm. Maybe it's just exhaustion. The pressure is off, in a way. There's nothing to "save" my season. It is what it is. I'm just here to play. My anxiety is still there, but it's like a distant radio. I can hear the static, but I'm not listening to the words.

November 9, 2025

Won a round. Played a top-50 guy and won. 7-6 in the third. I wasn't even tight. I was down 3-5 in the tiebreak, and I just... played. I hit a screaming forehand winner. I don't even know where it came from. The anxiety was gone. For those few points, I was just... playing tennis. It was the best I've felt on a court all year. I'm still buzzing.

November 16, 2025

Lost the next round. But I don't even care. That one win... it's enough. It's validation. It proves that I can do it. That the anxiety doesn't always have to win. I flew home today. The season is over. The stress is lifting, replaced by a profound, bone-deep exhaustion. I'm going to turn off my phone, and I'm not going to touch a racket for two weeks. I've earned that.

November 23, 2025

It's weird. No alarm. No practice schedule. No flight to catch. My anxiety doesn't know what to do with itself. It's still there, flaring up at weird times. "Are you stretching?" "Are you eating right?" "You're getting lazy." I'm trying to tell it to shut up. Trying to just be. It's harder than playing a match. The stress of not being stressed is a new, weird feeling.

November 30, 2025

Saw my family. Really saw them. Talked to my friends. It's amazing how this sport isolates you. I realized how much of my identity is "tennis player" and how little is just... me. It's stressful. Who am I without the racket? I need to find balance. This year of anxiety and pressure has shown me that. I can't let this sport be the only thing that defines me.

December 7, 2025

Met with Dr. Lee in person. We reviewed the year. The panic attacks, the injuries, the burnout, the small victories. He said I'm incredibly resilient. It didn't feel like it. It felt like I was drowning most of the time. But maybe he's right. I'm still here. I'm still standing. The anxiety is part of my story, but it's not the whole story. The stress is a signal, not a sentence.

December 14, 2025

Picked up a racket today. Just to hit with my old coach. No pressure, no drills. Just hitting. It felt... fun. I'd forgotten what that felt like. The off-season training block starts next week. The anxiety is already knocking, "Are you ready? It's going to be hard." But this time, I have an answer. "Maybe. But I'll be there." The stress is coming. I know it. But for the first time... I think I'm ready for it.
