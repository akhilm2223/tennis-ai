Play your BEST tennis under pressure! - Mental Toughness Lesson
Essential Tennis - Lessons and Instruction for Passionate Players

how would you like to play your best
tennis in the biggest moments instead of
crumbling Under Pressure that's exactly
what you're about to learn how to do as
I deconstruct the recent upload by Kell
from my tennis HQ he had an incredible
result in a set against Taylor Fritz the
current world number 12 and his reaction
to that result speaks volumes about the
difference between the mental toughness
of worldclass players and regular
everyday ones like you and me let's dive
right into
it first we need to make some important
context connections here between
ourselves in somebody like Karo and so
here's something I put together really
quick called the mental toughness
Spectrum mental toughness isn't an onoff
switch we might have low mental
toughness medium or high let's define
those really quick if currently you have
low mental toughness then it means that
you completely fold under any pressure
on the quartz you basically become a
totally different player during
competition you slow down to be careful
use worse technique you basically don't
have any ability to kind of be yourself
during competition medium toughness
let's say is somebody that has some
ability to stay confident in the face of
anxiety and pressure but you can't quite
reach your full potential when it really
matters the most and then we've got high
mental toughness this is somebody who
might actually perform better in the
face of of anxiety and pressure and this
is a tennis player that is able to use
their best skills under pressure and all
of them are available and you can swing
with total freedom and confidence no
matter what is on the line now an
important thing to point out here is
there's not a direct connection between
mental toughness and level of play as a
player there's definitely some
connection but it's not one to one so
going back to the the chart here I I
made another one tennis Talent spectrum
and so if you're not familiar 2.5 is
basically a beginner player here in the
United States 4.5 is an advanced player
it's only about the top 10% or so of
tennis players are at 4.5 or above and
then we've got 6.0 which basically means
professional tennis player between six
and seven means that you make your
living playing tennis so what's
important to keep in mind is there are
let's say three five tennis players that
have very high mental toughness
and you probably know some 4.5 level
players some like pretty strong Advanced
players who have terrible mental
toughness and they're all the way down
at the bottom of the spectrum it's
important to remember that while mental
toughness is definitely important is
just one of the big key pillars of being
a good well-rounded tennis player
there's technical skills there's Fitness
and conditioning there's tactics and
strategy and then there's the mental
game so the mental game certainly is
critically important but you can be an
advanced player without having a good
mental game and you can have a great
mental game and not necessarily be a
super high level player yet and so I
just wanted to lay the groundwork here
just to make sure we're kind of all the
same on the same page and talking about
the same thing okay so back to karo's
set he obviously played lights out in
terms of his tennis but what really
jumped out at me was his own personal
reaction to the outcome he kept
downplaying the importance of the result
because he kept saying it was just a
practice set and I find this rather
profound because the environment that K
and Taylor were playing in would have
absolutely terrified 99% of tennis
players out there they both knew that
there was a camera on the court and it
was being recorded number one that's
probably already making some of you
sweat out there number two they both
knew that potentially this could be seen
by tens of thousands or maybe even
hundreds of thousands of people if it
got published to K's channel number
three Karu personally has been working
super hard to level up his game keep
playing higher levels of competition of
course the whole goal for him is to make
it as a professional tennis player and
what better way to find out kind of
where he stands than by playing this set
so the implications for him emotionally
like psychologically could really be
huge and over on Taylor's side side of
the courts we don't want to lose to
somebody who we know is lower ranked or
they're on the lower team or their
rating is lower like we've got something
to prove when we go out there in
practice the last thing we want to do is
lose to somebody who we feel like we
shouldn't lose to right you can relate
to that so be honest put yourself in
their shoes put yourself in that
situation with all of those same factors
all layered at the same time how would
it make you feel on the court if you
were in that situation well I actually
happened to know something about this
because for over a decade I've been
recording myself coaching and I've been
recording myself playing and Publishing
it to the internet in front of hundreds
of thousands of people and over that
time I've personally grown in my own
mental toughness a ton because I've had
to face the pressure and anxiety of
cameras and viewers over and over and
over again and if you don't believe that
it makes a big difference by the way
listen to all these other players talk
about it most of whom are actually a
higher level than me and have more high
level experience than I do on the court
the cameras and microphones definitely
add a different aspect to it I feel like
I was thinking about it a little bit in
the back of my head you know yeah I was
going through my head uh a good amount
but I tried to block it out it's easier
to be comfortable and like relaxed when
you're in your own environment and
things like that so I think that
probably played a a major role I mean
it's uh very different being uh on
camera being uh recorded and just kind
of having that in the back of my mind
knowing Everyone's Watching and
commentating what's fascinating about
this is that the same environment can
affect different people in completely
different ways somebody who didn't play
competitive junior tennis didn't play
High School tennis and didn't play
college tennis has maybe just kind of
played in some USA leagues here and
there is going to be hugely affected by
playing on camera where tens of
thousands of people are going to see the
outcome somebody like me or most of the
other players that have played on my
Essential Tennis Channel or my real
tennis Channel with the matches with the
commentary and stuff like that most of
us have played junior tennis played High
School tennis played college tennis but
we're still affected by it now to
somebody like Karo on the other hand who
has played for way way higher Stakes
than
99.99% of us ever will with more
pressure than any of us can ever imagine
who are just kind of normal everyday
tennis players the environment with the
camera and the YouTube audience and even
a top level Pro across Ross the net from
him isn't enough to knock him even
slightly off his game in fact I'd say
just from where I'm sitting that there's
probably a really high chance that he
played better than average in this set
against Taylor Fritz because the
Dynamics of the camera and his opponent
pumped him up to play his best while for
Taylor on the other side of the net it
was really just kind of another day at
the office and kuu whenever you see this
let me know in the comments down below
if I'm on the right track with those
comments or if you feel like I'm off
base I'll be sure to pin your comment to
the top so if you're not CaRu and you
haven't played college tennis or High
School tennis and you don't have a
YouTube channel like how can we build up
our mental toughness like if you're if
you feel like currently you're hanging
out towards the bottom of the mental
toughness Spectrum how can we move
ourselves up more towards the top well I
think the solution lies in a diagram
that I refer back to a lot in my person
coaching that I call the concentric
circles of learning and basically what
this illustrates here is relationship
between how we spend our time and how
well we're able to grow in any phase of
the game of tennis in the middle is our
our comfort zone like that's what we
just feel comfortable doing it's our
skills that are most familiar whatever
we're used to is here in our comfort
zone then just outside of our comfort
zone is the Learning Zone and so this is
where we're not comfortable but we're
not so uncomfortable that we lose
control of what we're doing and just
kind of freak out and that's the Panic
Zone the Panic zone is so far outside of
our comfort zone that we basically go
into fight or flight and we just kind of
go into our base instincts and just want
to get the heck out of there and we lose
control of what we're doing and we don't
really grow or improve because we're
just is constantly in a state of panic
this works for technical skills and this
works for mental toughness skills as
well want to hang out as much as
possible in the Learning Zone so that
you can continue to improve and upgrade
your skills so on average if you just
push yourself 10% 20% outside your
outside of your comfort zone
consistently I promise you that over
time you will build and develop mental
tools and skills you build familiarity
just like K is talking about like guys
this is no big deal like I've I've
trained you know with with these top
guys like all the time it's no big deal
there's familiarity there he's left his
comfort zone enough times with these top
players that it actually starts to
become his comfort zone and then when
there's the extra pressure of the
cameras and the YouTube channel and I'm
trying to level up my game and be a
full-time Pro then that actually just
makes him play better so I challenge you
wherever you are right now leave your
comfort zone by 10% 20% do it
consistently and you'll keep leveling up
your mental game and the rest of your
game too thanks for watching talk to you
again
soon
