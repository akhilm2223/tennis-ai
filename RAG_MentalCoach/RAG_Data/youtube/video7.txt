Number ONE Tennis Mental Toughness Tip
Jorge Capestany Tennis

hi guys coach Jorge capistan today I
have an answer for one of the questions
that came to our website about metal
toughness what's the number one tip so
obviously I have a lot of ideas on metal
toughness it's the area most players
don't train and frankly but I'm going to
show you and tell you this probably the
number one most helpful thing that I
ever heard of a younger player and when
I competed a lot it helped me the most
and also it's also been helping my
students the most and it's just a
concept so I'm not gonna hit a lot of
balls here I just want you to think
about this and maybe see if you can
apply it to your own game so here's the
deal US tennis players are passionate
and when we make errors we tend to judge
those when when I make a backhand down
the line and it's wide I will judge that
as bad okay but my opponent the same
exact shot my backhand that went a foot
wide I say it's bad what does my
opponent say he thinks it's great so
obviously it can't be both it's really
all has to do with perspective so the
idea that I want you to grasp onto here
and maybe try is when you play
especially when you make play errors but
even on your best shots you have to be
more dispassionate you have to detach
yourself from the results and just treat
it like you're the chair umpire so let's
go back to that example I hit a backhand
wide I think it's bad my opponent thinks
it's good the chair umpire he doesn't
think either he just thinks it's it's a
way back in so the one thing I would
really ask you to try is to make sure
the next time you do errors before your
mind starts yelling at your body and
getting all upset that you just kind of
treated as data nothing more than data
but it's important that we harvest that
data so if I hit a backhand wide rather
than judge oh my gosh I screwed up again
I'm so slow I can't believe in my back
ends a joke none of that kind of talk
just know that I hit the backhand wide
and that means I had to be a little bit
back behind it so I'm gonna take that
data actually use it I'm not gonna go
into a complaining mode and I'm gonna go
into you know thinking mode and I'm say
okay next time very dispassionately has
to be more in front and if I hit it more
in front and this time I get way in
front I hit it cross-court the other way
too far then I'll just use that data so
there's tons of data points every single
results and shot in tennis is a data
point there
thing they're us tennis players have to
do a lot better job but just kind of
letting go the good or bad it's neither
really okay
no one's dying because of a tennis
manager especially a missed shot and
just kind of treated as data use the
data but not judge it if you can get
good at that I can guarantee you're
going to play with a lot more piece that
you're gonna probably have a lot better
results so that's my tip for you and the
number one tip I try to teach my players
when it comes to mental toughness so
