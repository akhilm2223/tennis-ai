this video is sponsored by apik
what's up everyone crew here from my
tennis hq hope you guys are doing great
and today we're going to talk about a
topic that we get a lot of requests
about
it's not there's not going to be a lot
of tennis in this in this video to be
honest it's going to be more of like a
talking video sharing experiences and
things like that
but the topic of this video is like the
title said
dealing with match pressure met pre-mesh
nerves and anxiety that's something i
think a lot of
amateur players and junior players
struggle with and to be honest it's not
just
them it's pretty much every player at
whatever level
they're dealing with that before we
begin let me just say i'm not a sports
psychologist at all i don't have any
formal training in in that area but i've
been playing tennis for
over 20 years and i've been playing
tournaments my entire
life pretty much so um i have a lot of
experience dealing with that
um good good experiences negative
experiences
so just making sure i throw that out
there
before anyone starts saying you should
be talking about this so you know you
don't have proper training or whatever
so
okay so match nerves match anxiety
however you want to call it it's
it's not a great feeling right it's like
very annoying to feel like you
were training well and playing well and
coming into maybe like a tournament or a
match
thinking that you're going to play a
good match
and that you're confident confident
about your strokes but those nerves
just never seem to settle and you just
can perform
at the level you're expecting however
whatever that level is my
you know if you're very high level if
you're just starting and more often than
not
bad performances stem from
nerves and anxiety and never feeling
like you settled mentally into the match
you know what to do with your body your
body knows what it has to do
but sometimes your mind gets in the way
of that and that's something that is
really frustrating
and it's hard to to deal with especially
when you're just starting to play
tournaments and learning how to you know
navigate the match just there's so many
things that are
happening it can become a little bit
overwhelming so a few common reasons
that you might be anxious or feeling
nervous before a match i think number
one
and it's gonna sound like a cliche but
you're just human everyone feels nerves
you can
talk about any professional athlete i've
you know i've been
traveling around with someone who's just
won two grand slams and
trust me it hasn't been just smooth
sailing mentally there's
there's tough days that you know we have
to overcome
and the same happened back when i played
i
i felt you know anxious i felt nerves i
you know had the yip sometimes on some
strokes
and that's just normal you know there's
very few people that
can navigate through those things
without feeling any nerves i think even
the most confident people
that you know are still you know feeling
nervous for
whatever the reason is like maybe you
just don't want to lose to someone who
is
weaker than your than you or you again
your mind is
playing a little a few tricks with you
at this point but
it's you got to kind of accept that
you're going to feel those things and
you don't want to try to fight them as
much you want to
try to like work around them and feel
like
you can still compete when you're
feeling those things another reason that
you might be feeling a lot of
nerves and anxiety before playing
especially tournaments
is because you just don't have
experience playing those
kind of events and being in that
situation and i've been doing this since
i was five you know i've been playing
tournament since i was eight i've
played countless matches through my life
and i remember the feeling of anxiety
most of them but i've learned how to you
know kind of deal with them and how to
maybe start the match
a certain way that helps me get through
them
and this is a problem i
have even with some of my players that
because you're so inexperienced and you
haven't played that many events
any match is too special and when every
match is too special
whatever the match is like a first round
match of your club league whatever it is
it's going to be hard to perform when
you push put too much into just that one
match
it's going to be really hard to perform
you always have a next week you're
always going to have a next chance
obviously borrowing and
injuries and things like that so don't
make
that the tournaments or the matches too
special
like they should be actually fun like
you the pressure that you're feeling
for um you know before a match and it's
something that i will talk about a
little bit
later in the video should be actually
exciting it's like it's
good anxiety it's it's going to like get
you going instead of like
kind of like bring you down so don't put
too much emphasis on on
any match or any term and um try to at
least have a little bit more fun and
with time with your experience
playing playing playing just play more
play more play more
you're going to learn how to deal with
that a little bit better another reason
another reason that you might be
struggling with this is that
we hardly put as much work as we should
in our mental strength like i think we
go on the court we hit a lot of
forehands and we do
fitness if you're certain that level of
doing fitness but no one is really
putting the thought of okay i actually
need to train
my mental side as well it's it's
complicated it can be expensive
and our mind is tricky it's like a very
you know i
you know try to read a lot about this
and the brain
it's often not on our side he kind of
you know wants to find ways to make
things harder
so you know finding ways to train our
minds
could be through meditation it could be
through a lot of things
it has to be part of the daily routine
as well i think
we we're not putting as much emphasis on
on that
side of to the training and we just
expect that magically we're just not
going to feel any pressure we're not
going to feel any nerves we're not going
to feel any anxiety we're just not going
to feel
anything we're just going to be peak
performance novak djokovic clutch and
it's just not the way it is yes even a
guy
like novak or like you know the guys
that have to
constantly you know be a peak
performance and deal with pressure of
winning every term and they're having to
work on their mental strength as well
because
uh trust me tennis is so mentally taxing
you can tell
you know i'm on the tour traveling on
the tour now seeing players
man it's tough it's not easy out here
and it's not easy at any level in tennis
so
you got to make sure you still you're
working on with your
on your mind and you're working on that
skill as well it's not just
uh physical and technical it's also
mental train
mental training so here are some ways
you can fix your mental
weight
yo what's up dude just happen again man
i keep training training super hard and
and i keep choking matches i don't know
what's going on like i
i'm putting all the work on the court
that i can't but like i just keep
losing these matches that i shouldn't be
losing well have you been training your
mind as well what are you talking about
i mean the same amount of work that
you're putting into your
strokes and fitness you should be
putting into your mind as well
but i can't afford a sports psychologist
it's too expensive well have you tried
this app called apik
no what's that here it's a great app
dude
it's specifically designed for tennis
players to help them create positive
mental habits build stronger character
and increase their performance on the
court
oh really does everything through an app
how does it do that i'm glad you asked
so all right so we partnered up with ap
this is a really cool app
uh i'm really excited for this
partnership because i think
this is something that was missing for
tennis players apic is a new app that i
think is going to help
a lot of tennis players it was designed
by someone who played tennis but also
went to school for sport sports psych
and understands what you need to do on a
daily basis to
train uh your mind and build mental
strength
and the daily mental training currently
works in three stages with
pre-match visualization post-match
reflection
and post-match visualization as well or
post-practice it could be for matches or
for practice and you can track
your progress so here's how it works so
stage number one is
pre-match or practice visualization so
for example
let's say today i have a match versus a
weaker opponent and i'm a bit nervous a
bit anxious about playing this
weaker opponent i will choose the weaker
opponent prompt
and listen to it before playing so after
my match or practice
i go back to stage number two which is
post match or practice reflection
so you've got two boxes in which you can
you're gonna write what went well that
day and what went bad so
i'll write what when well let's say i
was hitting my forehand well my server
really well that day i went to the
network or something like that
and i'll write what went bad so let's
say i lost a match where
i served for and i you know was a close
match and just kind of choked
that's something that a lot of players
struggle with
when i write that the the cool part is
that the apps ai
will recommend a match visualization
exercise
tailored to what went bad in that
specific day so let's say i couldn't
close out the match i'll write that and
it will give me these prompts
which is really cool it kind of caters
to what i did badly that day
and then comes step three which is
listening to one of those prompts
and kind of put me in a
good frame of mind even though things
were bad
helps me put in the right frame of mind
and you know be okay with the bad things
that i that i did
and there's again a bunch of prompts in
there that can help you in
many different scenarios
try a peek out i'm excited for this
partnership they're going to be
i'm going to talk about them more and
more in the channel
um maybe i'll do a full review of that
if that's something you want to see
uh leave a comment down below but let's
go back to the video and talk a little
bit more about
how can you improve your mental strength
and deal with those match nerves and
anxiety
so number one is just building a good
routine and i'm not just talking about
the hit that you're gonna have or the
warm-up that you're gonna have
off-court um you could obviously find
what
works best for you maybe it's a longer
hit there's a shorter hit
a little more activation footwork
outside
the cord like you can you can find ways
play around with ways that
on and off the chord are going to help
but also like how can you
maybe like shift the focus from the
match to something else
do you want to be hyper focused into the
mesh do you want to sort of like forget
about it and let your
let your mind kind of think about other
things i you know you can be listening
to music i actually personally
used to listen to audiobooks before
matches just to like
kind of forget about the match a little
bit forget about the
you know sometimes you're thinking about
it too much you're like what am i going
to do with this and that like you
already
know what you're going to do there's
nothing else you're going to learn it's
just getting in there and competing so i
think good routines
with eating with just building something
that like you can't really
blame anything else besides
hey i got in i got out maybe i lost but
like my routine was good and i keep
doing that
and keep finding the one that's gonna
work for you i think that's incredibly
important
for any player at any level number two
is working on mental strength as much as
you work
on your tennis game and your fitness
whatever it is obviously i just
did a little ad for a peek
and that's a great tool that you can use
but you can also find
something else that might help you can
be a sports psychologist
it could be anything that really puts
you in a good state of mind it could be
doing yoga it can be doing
meditation there's there's all sorts of
ways that can help you
strengthen your mind this is something
that is new to me as well it's not
something that i was doing i was younger
i wish i was doing i was younger i think
it would have helped me a lot so
building that kind of
mental strength through training it's
really really important
i think you just it's almost like a must
have for any player number three is
actually playing
a lot more play a lot of events play a
lot of matches forget
too much about drilling and things like
that just play a lot
because you are going to put yourself in
this
that pressure situation that anxiety
situate anxiety situation more often
the more often you're in that situation
the more you can learn it's like oh i
went for this shot
it doesn't work when i'm feeling
pressure i went for
this shot oh this shot is really has
really worked
i think gil simone just had a uh
just wrote a book and in that book he
talks about the
you know how kind of french players are
labeled chokers and things like that
but what he mentioned is that guys like
novak and feather and rafa
they really know who they are during
those pressure situations and they
know exactly the shots they can go for
that they can trust
all the time and obviously too obviously
at smaller
level this is something that you need to
learn from your game i knew exactly
what i could do in those situations i
wasn't the guy who was going to
you know at five four forty thirty
serving for it just
going to probably ace someone probably
not hope hopefully but probably not
i knew how i wanted the point to be
played and and
this is only going to happen if you
really really
uh commit to playing a lot and and
feeling uncomfortable you need to learn
how to feel uncomfortable and play when
you're
uncomfortable and there's no really
way out of it you're always going to
feel pressure you're always going to
feel anxiety but the more you play
the more you put yourself into to that's
to those situations the more
you're going to learn about your game
how you can play in those situations i
shouldn't play in those situations and
then you can work on those things they
work backwards so like oh i played i did
this badly
i can go back and actually work on that
and the last point i want to make is
have fun i had
the experience of you know having
players where
they almost enjoy practice more than
they enjoy matches because
once they get to the match and they're
feeling pressure they lose and it's just
frustrating because you're putting all
these hours into the core
then you're losing the matches and it's
you can tell they're not really having
fun whether when they're competing and
you there's a clear difference of
players that enjoy competition also kind
of more than practice and vice versa and
competition should be fun competition is
fun come this is the reason why we
we kind of do it obviously for more
amateurs that maybe just do it for the
exercise
i understand it but for you know players
that reach out and just like how can i
deal with this
you're obviously trying to win more
matches but you got to enjoy that you
guys
you got to make you know almost like a
little kid for me i'm always like a
little kid when i you know i train
certain things and i
was able to do it on the court i'm like
oh this was great so
you got to be able to have fun on the
court as well and don't think it's
like you know it's kind of just a job i
have to win this match
so really find ways that you can feel
like you're enjoying that your time on
the court
you're actually having fun on the court
it's going to help you a lot oh and of
course
breathing breathing is so important i
think a good way to sometimes deal with
mesh nerves is actually
grunting because it's going to make you
real exhale and then you have to inhale
and you're going to be breathing
so sometimes we like hold that tension
in so much and we're so tense
like this without no breathing
make sure you're hitting and you're
breathing and you're taking your time
in between points to breathe to to kind
of like
you know the passes the past the future
it's the future the only thing you can
really control it's the right now the
next point
um breathing is so so important there's
all sorts of breeding techniques i'm not
pro in that in any way so you can
probably i'll try to google
or youtube some that i i think would be
good i'll try to link it down below but
breathing is so important it's so
important it's again something that i
didn't really focus as much uh growing
up and even like during my pro career
but i think it's
really really important for a game it's
probably the easiest thing that you can
do and there's massive massive benefits
so
work on your breathing deep breaths it
can be
just through the nose nose and mouth
mouth whatever it is but try to breathe
more
through the nose and again exhale when
you hit grunt do whatever but like let
that air go so you can
bring more oxygen in is going to help
you a lot so that's it for this video
i know it was you know a little bit long
and boring just me talking no tennis and
this is supposed to be a tennis channel
but
this is something that we get a lot of
requests about it and it's something
that it's
a subject that is hard that you know we
we all deal with it sometimes we don't
talk about it and you know we just
internally struggle
but there are tools out there there are
ways to help you do this
obviously like i talked about in the
video a peek is a great app it's
designed specifically for
for tennis players i wouldn't be selling
it if i wouldn't be supporting it if i
didn't believe in it and i think
