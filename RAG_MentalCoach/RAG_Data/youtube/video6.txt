Play like you practice: Beat tennis nerves 
StokkeTennis

if you struggle with nerves or swinging freely on the ball if you struggle with taking your practice level to the match
court this is the podcast episode for you Jeff Greenwald is one of the Premier Sports psychologists in all the world
and he came on my podcast last year to discuss these topics it was easily my most downloaded episode of 2024 so I
hope you enjoy all right Jeff welcome to the pod great to be here Jonathan thank you uh this is something we'll get right
to the good stuff right away so whenever I have a sports psychologist the mental side of the game every player I've ever
coached deals with nerves and when I put up the Instagram questions there were a lot of things how do I play with nerves
how do I play looser how do I handle it when I get tight so I guess maybe to start off I'm wondering if you can kind
of generally speaking kind of describe why people get nervous when they're playing a
recreational sport like tennis because they're anxious that they're anxious how about that it's
pretty deep kick it off right away right I mean you know no Novak talks everybody gets
nervous so does he there's no match he's ever played that he didn't feel nervous and all that and and we can talk a good
game everybody can just talk about their nerves but when you're out there when
you feel those feelings the the the feet slow down and your arm gets a little bit rubbery or
you're you double faulted once and you're scared it's going to happen again and the re retreating and trying not to
Miss and um you know going to the Future and worrying so all of the this anxiety
of the anxiety is is a big deal because if you can cut that out if if players
can really manage that and recognize okay accept it and I mean radically
accept it do you want to be nervous no do it feel good not at all and but like
you you really do have to have a new perspective on the experience of the
nerves of course how you interpret it and that's a big deal too so there's a lot we can talk about here today I know
yeah yeah I'm going to I'm going to open that up to you I'm going to use a golf example for me when I played my first
tournament I mean I can't tell you how nervous I was but my feedback from the nerves was I went oh I stand closer to
the ball when I'm nervous oh I don't turn as much on my back swing when I'm nervous and so the next time I played a
tournament of course I was terrified again and I went oh remember last time this is what happened so I did the
opposite I stood farther from the ball I tried to turn more than usual and I hit a great drive and I immediately relaxed
so is that something kind of figuring out what those nerves do to you is that a good way to handle that I think that
awareness is huge and I love how you said you did the opposite so you know that's really uh a great approach
because we do get um conditioned into doing the same thing over and over we back off usually that's the the thing
that players do is get tentative they try not to to miss because they don't feel good they don't feel like they're going to make it I get it but we have to
stop avoiding that moment and and we have to release the ball we because the
more we do it the more we back off the safer we play try not to miss we reinforce the fear and it and we stay in
this vicious cycle but as soon as you are sort of coaching your brain if you
will your brain is going oh my god oh no don't miss and you're like yeah no I'm about something else here I'm about
releasing I'm about playing forat Mastery I'm I'm I'm in the driver's seat not you fear um then you you start to
really make massive massive progress I call the upward spiral you know after
that because you you you've really sort of um taken control of the of what you have control over right so yeah do you
so one thing I coach is you know people can't hit more winners on purpose like
if they could Novak would be not be he'd be hitting more than 20% winners in a match like objectively he just would
it's an easier way to win but you can't force winners and so a great way to improve in my opinion is you start
reducing all the unforced errors you could make you reduce double faults you make more returns you get more balls
over the net stop missing wide and for me I have no problem thinking of those
things in a positive light like I'm going to hit higher over the net I'm going to hit more middle a lot of people
when I hear you talking about that tentative mindset they get scared they go oh I'm trying not to miss and they
decelerate is there a healthier way to communicate that or experience those
thoughts yeah so what you're describing is the ability and willingness to focus
on something else other than yourself what happens is when we get anxious when we get tight our focus goes Inward and
we are now extremely self-conscious and protecting we have to do as he was indicating earlier the opposite we have
to get our attention onto tactic we got to get on to the Target and commit to
something that matters to you so what I realize is that when I'm as committed to
releasing the ball being loose being aggressive moving the ball around when I'm committed to that regardless of the
outcome that that is an incredibly different place to be and but the bottom
line is you got to get your focus off yourself because you find yourself in the web in your own internal web and you
got to get your focus out outside of yourself what would be the first step so
let's say a recreational player is out there it's five all in the first set and you know we're not necessarily the
thinker of our own thoughts but it hits them like a ton of bricks and they go man I am tight what is step one to
handling that situation so if you've practiced the deep breathing deep diaphragmatic breathing like if you if
the room was hot helps cool the room right so if you really know how to breathe properly breathing in through
your nose exhaling out through your mouth no vac is the master and um and
and you train that you you know even a minute a day but if you actually do it
properly breathing in you could be a four count in one second hold six out everybody has you know different
versions it could be four and four you know but the the the slower the exhale
the better because that kicks in this parasympathetic nervous system relaxes the body so you you that one deep breath
if you've done it a bit through the day a couple times um and you do it properly that breath is going to take you down
from call it a 10 tight or an eight it's going to drop you down you know a peg or
two right so so that's just a reset breath it's not going to get rid of the nerves people often a it didn't work
it's not going to get rid of them but it's going to put you in the driver's seat it's going to reset you and now
you've got a pivot point to refocus on something so what do you do you focus on the ball you focus on your your target
so you pick one thing to come back to and it's the coming back that's so key
you know if we're lost in the nerves and I know it can really hijack us it absolutely does we have to pick
something to refocus on to interesting yeah it's just such a
difficult thing and everyone has their own little outcome or outside force that
kind of drives the nerves and that's why it's I guess it's probably interesting for you as a sports pist because it's
not the same exact thing every time but how do expectations either self expectations or
external expectations kind of affect nerves how do you see that working together well the expectations are
probably I'm I'd almost put it at the number one you know slot in terms of the
the mistake players are making relative to their nerves so there's there's a you
know you're going to win or lose it's pretty in tennis right there's no tie so we know at the end of two hours ish
there's going to be a winner or a loser and and that uncertainty because the brain does not like uncertainty so
it's going to try to predict what's GNA happen you know what are my chances today there a seven utr I'm a I'm a you
know I'm a 6.5 you know the whole utr sort of negotiation the terrorist
negotiation so you know um that is um um
where we we also come up with the shoulds I should win I call it a sixlet swear word you know because it's just it
is such a there's nothing good that comes out of it but the brain churns that out I mean think about oh I should
you oh yeah you should beat him or I should the so if you win you get nothing out of that sort of from that standpoint
and then you just put all the pressure on yourself if you don't meet those expectations so the expectations you
really want to have are about your commitment to Rel releasing through the ball how loose were you how intense were
you how focused were you um did you on breakpoint for the third time um were
you really willing to to to play with controlled aggression well you know what are you what are you committed to and
and that's really what you want to base your expectations on rather than am I gonna beat this guy and what are people
gonna say of course after you know it's it's funny I'm curious what you think about this but I had a guy at Duke and
he had some anger issues and you know he was losing to guys but they were
basically the same level and so every metric-wise every utr results same spot
in the lineups and I said okay let's just say you guys are exactly the same level and you played 10 times how many
times do you think you'll win and he said six or seven and I was like that's
interesting because that sounds like you're better than that guy then you know like he had this expectation that even though on paper he knew he's about
the same he expected to win essentially probably deep down
almost every time and so when he was losing it was like what is going on on here and that led to that
frustration and the the interesting thing Jonathan about that sort of mindset whether it's you know inflating
your own level or just not paying attention to the stats which I'd like to talk about talk about in a moment but
like you know the the pros when you hear them talking of course when they go on
the court they just want to get done with the interview right when on the through the tunnel they're like okay let me just go play but but whether before
or after you know there's the the best in the world don't talk about winning
and losing as much as the people who are struggling with nerves Etc and
confidence it's there's a there's a inherent understanding among athletes
who are um whove who've played and succeeded that it is about Mastery and
the truth is it is about Mastery for everybody but there's this outcome
problem that you know because of course you want to win and losing is painful and it's it's more painful than losing
is or winning is enjoyable right the the pain of losing right it it hurts and we
could get into that all day long about self-worth being attached to the outcome
but um I just think that um the more players focus in on on the Mastery on
what on the expectations of what they have control over obviously how loose they are the
intensity the focus how they carry themselves moving on from the last Point these are things that that if you get
really engaged with these factors of course the great irony is it leads to
more winning anyway I've heard so I would say I have high standards for
myself and for my players I expect you to have great effort I expect you to have a good attitude but in the last
year or two as a coach I've kind of adopted zero expectations like if a parent says what do you think for the
match I always go I have no idea like I guess what we're going to find out in two hours but I have no idea what's
going to happen they had a great practice great practices don't always lead to Great matches and poor practices don't lead to poor matches so I've
gotten to the point now where I have zero expectations is that a bad thing am I going too far overboard on that I ask
players let me let's look at it this way Jonathan let's say you could know for the rest of your life you're gonna win
you go here's a tournament coming up you're going to lose five in the third 75 in the third set in the semi-final
you'll beat the guy in the quarters 7664 and you knew that ahead of time how excited are you to go play that
tournament yeah not very yeah I mean like we I think
misinterpret the nerves it's exciting I mean to not know the brain doesn't like
it at first blush like oh well it's GNA happen I get it but that's also the
excitement of of it and if if people could could just be more willing to
endure the not knowing tolerate it and go out and re and really focus on these
specific intentions as I call them before you actually walk on the court what are your two intentions so you can
come back to them it's a different dimension of of um that you're playing
from it's a different dimension and literally it's like you're embodying a different space you don't you're not feeling the pressure like the same way
way you know you feel pressure still but you're embracing it and you're focused
more narrowly on what's going to help you play better you're not hijacked and pulled in and out of the past and the
future it's a completely different place a few minutes ago you mentioned uh stats
that you wanted to get into I I want to make sure you you give me those because I'm interested in that well sure yeah
and let me go back you said about expectations you know is it too much I mean we can obviously go overboard with
everything some somebody listening could be like oh you know the Mastery process outcome debate right it's all about
process and I'm not saying I just want to be clear no it's about outcome
too and it's about how are you showing up for all in the first set you know you
got some nerves and you know are you backing off are you stepping in and hitting the ball so it gets very binary
very fast in this in this conversation right but outcome is you know to get
into tournaments you need the rankings and the ratings and the whole thing okay great that makes this exciting and
challenging and painful now let's go focus on what matters it's going to help you play better okay so coming back to
uh to to the stats I mean I swear to you if somebody told me when I was 15 years
old Jeff and I was a perfectionist I wanted to win every Point yeah I'm very competitive at ballot teres duking it
out on the backcourts there and um and and that was like playing a tournament every day actually but um if
someone said to me you're gonna lose Jeff 45% of the points in every match you play playing anybody you know around
your level minimum and you can lose up to 50% and still win and by the way 45% if
you win 55 you're crushing them two sets six three three and three three and four
probably I would have been like what are you talking about you know they might have had to say here's the pizza cut out
this but I mean so when I was 15 or so actually I was 16
and I was at ballot teries and I'm playing this guy in the finals Chris lapr priori good player from New England
uh was from New England and I'm I'm you know 64 63 I think he got me but I I would miss a shot I I would just get so
upset so angry ah scream and they actually said you can't play in
this assoc FL Florida tennis Association anymore they kicked me out for it was a week Aaron kx's sister who was down
there said Jeff don't worry we'll get you know you got to write a letter though you got to write a letter and say you're sorry you're gonna fix it and I
did and they let me play I you know I said I'm sorry I take responsibility and I I got better I was very competitive I
wanted to win I hated missing the easy rally ball and um but if someone said I know
no idea that I could lose that amount of points now it's intellectual I get it but I think I would have absorbed that
and and when I missed you only lose one point for that I would have thrown it in the 45 50% bucket and why put it in the
7% bucket you're fighting for and Craig o shanesy who we did a course together
called getting tight actually and and um you know and he's been fantastic with
helping you know players figure out how how to think better about their
practices and matches relative to to the stats of course I I want to make sure so if I got this wrong I'm giving you
credit for it I'm pretty sure in that course getting tight you had the idea of permission slips yes and I have loved
that one forever because in my for me I'm about as robotic as it gets as a emotion you know human being and so I'm
like oh okay well have I ever played a match where I haven't missed 15 to 24 H like of course I do it every time I'm
going to try to make everyone but I know just based on the history of the tennis world everybody does that so why would I
get mad when I've missed my fifth Forin can you kind of explain that permission slip idea yeah yeah I mean it's
interesting because I know how that feels of course right when you you U you
know you might feel a little nerves or you go for something you you kind of debating whether you should but you do and you miss and it's super tempting on
the next next point to hold back right you don't want to give another free point away it's kind of a feels like a
sin doesn't it to give another free point they're just you know serve you miss or but what I have found is that if
you can again tolerate that moment and not let your
brain um direct traffic so to speak if you can let your brain oh okay time to
you know buckle up here and just get the ball back and and step in again and
commit maybe you need a little more top you know you got to go to the big Target not go as as close to the line sure
great you know go have a little shape on the ball but you're releasing the ball
you're not holding back and you're really willing and that's really the operative word here is you're willing so
the permission slip is you're really giving yourself that permission um because you're going to be
paid back dividends if you can stay stay the course there um you find that you get past that rough
patch of like make it miss you know should I and all that tug-of-war that's going on
inside uh it really cuts that stuff out and you becomes a lot cleaner and um
more you can be more decisive with this whole thing so yeah the permission slips are huge permission to miss as I call it
in my book um I think has been a big big uh you know helpful concept for people
so alongside with nerves and it's probably a big reason for this but a lot of players also say they play so much
better in practice oh I was hidden great but then I I'm not playing matches at the same level what are your thoughts on
that is are nerves the main reason for that level drop so two things on that
well a few but one is I don't think in particular player you know younger
players arguably even good um League competitive league senior players but I
think it gets better in terms of their intensity and practice I think the intensity of practice the quality of
practice is important I think kids and I see it all over the sort of this a
little lacad isical little unfocus certainly the intensity is too low and
it the the experience when you play a tournament match or you going into a tournament is so radically different you
know you just you've been kind of mailing and okay if you want to beat a guy in practice
and it's you you're in a breaker you want to win and that bragging rights or whatever it is there ego that can up it
but if you've been in clinics and you're playing you you really haven't been playing enough sets for example which I
think is probably another issue but I think the disparity and that
feeling I is too too wide and so that we got to close that Gap one being players
need to be more intense visualizing themselves you know on the court in the
tournament coming up for example before I play the men's 40 Nationals still and
um played 17 years now I'm 57 but I still love going down I was in the quarters this year still was able to
hang in there a little bit but um you know I'll visualize myself on that front Court I'll visualize you know in my mind
before I return um you know a week before hitting a backhand down the line or take you know picturing people
they're watching and I'll I'll recreate the experience in my mind a little bit
just to add some reality to it so when I'm actually there it's not feeling so
foreign and yeah my my best year as a junior was my second year
18 and my coach Billy Sterns who it was the most I improved in a year it was
phenomenal and if I was in practice playing a point and let's say I missed a backhand wide immediate two court
suicide and and number one like I'm tired so I don't want to do that and I
felt this pressure and this intensity and I used to love going to tournaments because I was like if I miss it's just a
point oh my God this is great I just get now I get to relax for 25 seconds and so I felt so free and I was in good shape
like it was almost less of a punishment it didn't stop me from being disciplined but I almost felt more relaxed in a
tournament than I did in a practice I love that I love that that's amazing and
and and so did you feel like in the tournaments you you thrived you know you you felt competitive and you didn't get
as hijacked maybe by the nerves that you could have been yeah I F I felt excited I obviously felt like I was in great
shape because I had done a lot of running in practice but the day I was like man in practice I
lose plus running plus maybe he screams at me plus all this and then I go into a
match I just lost a point and as long as it wasn't match point I'm good to go you
know and I wanted to keep winning so that I didn't have to go back and practice so like it wasn't like my competitive Drive was strong I just felt
great and in a way felt more relaxed than when I was maybe 12 or 14 which was
I would go to a tournament and I couldn't eat you know I was so nervous for these things right no that's a great
Point great example and and I think Jonathan that like you know again coming back and I think so important it's it's
easier said than done of course but when you're going when players are going into tournaments and they feel this the
nerves they feel the you know their dad mom's driving them and
or or you are you're driving yourself to the courts and and you want to beat this player and people know you're playing
that player and you know they're going to say oh how'd you lose to them or you know these I I said the first question
you typically get is what when you get off the court how'd you do did you win right I mean that's we've been conditioned brainwashed for years so
that's what in our you know the first thought is oh you know this is big I I need to come off the court be able to
say oh I won kind of deal but I think this interpretation of the feeling is
important is really important like it's it's it's normal U it'll it'll gradually go away
you you have your intentions you're excited to play you're excited to compete you got the adrenaline
absolutely U but you're you're not going to get have that energy be all stopped
up in you because you're you're going to you're scared to miss and youna hold
back and hope to win and all this stuff it's a terrible terrible downward spiral so it's I it's normal I'm excited to
play um you know I'm gonna focus and and prioritize my intentions going in so you
reroute your brain when it starts to Veer into oh no and these nerves and I
hate this feeling and it's it's you're you're just not in the driver's seat and that that's what players need to fix I
had a coach explain to me uh he said he said to the group of kids he said would you be happy if you won 0 and O in your
next tournament match and they said yeah I'd be happy and he was like oh well that's awesome you know what I can do we
were practicing next to the five-year-old Clinic he's like I'll just I'll draw them up first round you'll
beat them 0 and0 and everyone was like well I don't want to do that that's boring and so he was like oh okay well
yeah so deep down you kind of like the struggle number one and number two if you want to play Someone your level what
are the odds you're actually going to beat that person 0 and0 if you're actually supposed to be competitive so
he was kind of reframing it like even though you kind of don't want it to be a challenging match deep down you kind of
do right exactly and I think deep down as we were talking earlier you know you
said that was starting out deep on the be anxiety of the anxiety right which which it is people don't think of that
part but that's the layer I'm saying let's remove that let's deal with the
feeling okay but not the feeling of the feeling I mean we get right anxiety so
um so yeah I just think that that the way we we interpret this stuff and um is
is crucial um and being Loose by the way is something you can bake into your game
so this is the other thing so uh players typically you know the the classic is
you tell yourself to relax go for your shots and usually players do the opposite so why do you have to command
yourself to do something that normally you do in practice anyway mostly now you're telling yourself to do the thing
you're already supposed to be doing yeah so it's just a kind of a and of course Tim gway and inner game of tennis
captured this sort of voice of this command and control voice and and but
being loose is not a thought it's a feeling at the end of the day you're and it's happening on contact period when
you're loose your hand and your shoulder are releasing that ball or it's not and
you could be somewhere on the dial I do I use a dial one to 10 10 is as tight as you've ever played and one you'd never
want to play at a one right but but I found at about a four or five your grip
a little bit loose you know shoulder um you're not bracing on contact you're
you're letting that that rist go through the the contact that getting familiar with that
feeling as you're hitting you're not judging it and like Oh no you're just noticing you're aware of the feeling of
loose and you can bake it into your game day after day 10 minutes loose and then go up I have people go up the dial
Tighter and Tighter and then dropping the tension so they're intentionally getting tight hitting the ball okay I'll
take them six okay show me a seven show me an eight and then I'll take them back down the dial six show me six tell me
give me a four give me a two and then I bring them up I say well H you know how was that like that was
yeah was different and we say how well how did you get how did you get rid of that tension I just I just did I just
let it go I didn't did you tell yourself no you just let it drop and then that
feeling becomes more associated with your swing and it becomes more the norm
and you you can kind of calibrate better in matches so again it's a feeling it's
a physical feeling as opposed to a thought about being loose
I'm I'm going to have a hard time articulating this question but when players tell me I can't stop hitting in
the net my inner voice immediately is like aim higher dude like you're not
going to miss a lob in the net right or I keep missing wide or you know whatever
my hand is too tight and for me I'm like oh then loosen up your hand but in the
match when they feel those nerves like why is that harder no you don't really need to command yourself but it's really
not that difficult of a fix right like if you couldn't get the ball over the net and you said well are you capable of
physically hitting five feet higher over the net the answer is obviously yes and yet they will stay in the net and bury
balls what is the what is the thought or the skill or the Mantra that can get
someone into the present where they can solve this problem that deep down they easily know they should be able to solve
a great great question great anecdote I mean in that moment they are caught in
the problem right they're I'm hitting so many balls in the net and that's what they're caught in
and and so that's what they're getting more of what they don't want they're not willing to shift gears yet they're not
willing they don't even it's sort of the I don't know what I don't know place and
they're just reacting right and that's what happens when we get anxious and caught up in the outcome and what people
will say it's sort of this chronic tension stress and so it's the awareness
that helps get people gets you on the bus it doesn't get you to your destination the awareness but you got to
realize okay this is how I'm feeling this is what's happening be willing to
adjust that right make an adjustment and the reason to your you know question why
players don't just do it is because at
anything lower than the top 100 in the world arguably top 200 but pretty
quickly even the top 200 you're winning points when you play
safe you play you feel little nerves and you're like and you miss one free point
and you roll it back you start playing conservative and safe and your opponent might certainly sometimes step up and
get trigger happy and miss and you win matches players win matches not to
mention 12 and under you know 14s you're winning lots of matches and you played
safe 70% of the time and you won you know a fair amount of
matches this intermittent reinforcement playing safe and
winning it's like that tug award it's like well maybe I'll just maybe tomorrow I'll do that you know I'm gonna just I'm
gonna get this ball back man I just want I just want to win this one and then I'll start tomorrow kind of thing you know and so I think that intermittent
reinforcement is absolutely brutal place where players are getting stuck because they are being reinforced for playing
safe and that's why I you know I've just been passionate about this for so many years because I I just feel like at the
end of the day we want that feeling of being free of being loose releasing the ball and and of course it leads to
better outcomes anyway I had a ton of success especially like in the like in
the 14s I was always a top 10 player in the country but I would go through 14-year-old old tournaments I heard
remember one time in the finals I was up 6040 and the guy held serve and I beat
him 6061 and when I reported the score the tournament director he had a bag of
bagels and he said oh what was your score and I said 6061 and he took one B one Bagel out of the bag and he gave me
nine Bagels because that was the first game I had lost in the tournament but if you would like looking back on it I
played super tight and super conservative and I was definitely the best player in the tournament but I was
wasn't playing free and for me I don't know if you've had this with your players but it was almost like someone
flipping a light switch it was probably my first year 18s and I just got tired of being
nervous exctly and I was like it's so much easier to just go play and I now I
actually enjoy my two hours out there and I still by the way I play better when I'm loose so it's like there's no
downside but what maybe it was more of a gradual change but it felt like a flip of the switch where just went this is
stupid and exhausting I I I'll just go play and see what happens and it was like I never went back after that do you
do you see players experiencing that 100% And that's a great another great example because until we get sick of
something enough human behavior gets entrenched and we all know it's it's
hard and these questions coming in on Instagram I completely understand because um you know we get caught in
this cycle and and when you get TI tired of it you get tired of playing that way
of playing safe and the feeling of it and then yeah the outcome of it sometimes it works out but the feeling
of it and knowing in your heart that you're not playing the way you know you can you're not playing on your terms I
think there comes a point I hope there comes a point in time for everybody that
they say I'm I'm sick of this I want to I want to I really want the feeling of releasing the ball and I'm not going to
let my nerves uh control me I'm not going to let that dictate my choices you said I'm
sick of being nervous like that's one part the other is I'm sick of playing safe when I get nervous right and that's
something we have control over 100% you know we get nervous some consciously you know we care a lot we want to win you
know it's GNA happen we're gonna even if even when you're after Mastery and whatever and you have your intentions
you're still going to find yourself at different matches and situations a little bit nervous and but you can hold
on on to doing a percentage better releasing on the ball because you're
sick of the the way it used to be and you're not that person anymore and you know you shift your identity my identity
changed um as a player after I um I started to do this
and I mean then I'm you know years I played the tour I came off and um and I
was 20 what 24 years old and I go back at 35 and I'm playing and I was 79 in the
world ATP and now I'm playing Scott Draper who was 50 in the world the year before he had four match points on
Federer like three months after I played him and I'm up 53 in the Third on him and like so I'm coming back 12 years
later um and off the street literally like pre-qualifying in the qualies and
and the guy Scott Dre presented me after the match said so is sports psychology part-time or is tennis part-time like
what the hell you know but it does make a big difference when you play from this place for sure uh quick question are are
you like a hard out at 7 o'clock um or what is that four o'clock your time uh four you know it's uh
pretty pretty hard out at 4 yeah okay because I I have like nine I'm I'm G pick pick and choose the ones I like in
order okay so we're gonna wrap it up with Instagram questions uh first one which is huge one this person wanted to
know how do you build confidence and believe in yourself you you build confidence by re you know
having unconditional confidence because when confidence is based on just outcomes which it typically is you beat
that player and you know you played well and beat them uh you know and of course you get confidence when you beat
somebody better uh so that's a given and if you played well you're G to get more confident but the the confidence that we
have control over is uh you can make adjustments you know that you can release on the ball as we're talking
about even when you're a little nervous that you can refocus if your focus isn't
great you can refocus on the task at hand and and raise your intensity
because you're aware that your intensity is too low and you start moving your feet so being able to to to adjust and
control these things gives you you know a great deal of confidence
because it's not subject to just did you win or lose and did you play well this day and or not so that's where you want
to put your attention on all the things we're talking about here today um and and and really uh you know train some of
this stuff practice it yeah how do you prevent exploding when errors and
mistakes start piling up consecutively so I think that you know
sometimes it's funny some people who see me compete I'm I'm pretty intense out there um and then occasionally I'll let
out a ah you know and and they'll be like he's a sports psychologist you know it's like and laugh but I I believe it's
totally fine to emote to let it out God fine but you don't want it to
contaminate the next point so you have to have that perspective that it's okay to every now and then you're you're
human you're G to let you know let let it out let the steam out a little bit but it's just really important to come
back to the the present and that one mistake the two mistakes the three 45
50% you're going to lose anyway remember number so um you know it's very
instinctive to have an easy miss too right it's a sitter volley you miss and
it seems like it's worth a game it's one point and the faster you can move on the
better your chances of playing well and winning so if you're competitive if you're truly competitive and if you
really want to win then you got to win this inner game in that moment of not getting angry and letting your brain
drive the car and hijack you you've got to be more defiant more stubborn and not
relent to what your opponent and most people are victims of their own
situation own own chemistry and their so if you're competitive maybe reframe that
and mean you're going to stay calm throughout that entire match um and uh
focus on what you have control over and that's um and that'll help you um stay
more composed through the match we spoke pre-show about how difficult it is if
you're not an expert then how do you know you're getting good advice so I'm going to tell you something I heard from
golf a sports psychology tip and I want you to tell me if this applies to tennis or if you agree with the concept but the
person said that being surprised in a match or a golf
round being shocked like you said Miss a high volley that's what made me think of it so if I missed a six-inch putt or if
you missed an overhead on top of the net and that is super super surprising that engages high frequency in your brain and
sets you on this path of control and so the idea the person was talking about was of are you supposed to make a 100%
of easy volleys no so if you do miss one and you're not surprised you stay in low
frequency you can handle a little better is that concept I'm not an expert so I want you to I want your take on that because I found that super helpful for
me no it's super because if you're reacting to to thing over overreacting
and getting overly emotional is pulling you out of the bubble it's pulling you out of your own flow and zone right so brain frequency beta is that chatter and
you know you'll you're more likely to go into beta there as opposed to you know alpha or Theta right Theta is like
sleeping and but you want to be in this sort of Alpha and you know a little bit of theta in there it's okay like you
that lower frequency and when we emote when we get overly reactive double
fating is a great example one double fault two you know people freak out I can't tell you how
many people have called me for The Yips on their serve you know it's be in the last three years The
Yips um amazing like a a huge uptick on it and I don't know exactly why but um
people maybe maybe the pandemic got people more introspective and so forth but you know uh yeah you don't want to
be too surprised it's going to pull you out of your flow and you want to be more have more equinity more evenness
emotionally throughout the the match this person must know your work I'm not
familiar with this question but they said can you explain the sweep effect and why it's effective against opponents
that's so funny I wonder who that is that's so funny um I it's I told my son
you know I was kind of think sometimes I think I've been doing this a long time I'm like what are so some of the my favorite nuggets and you know and maybe
some of them are like you you get them early in your life and they help right my son I'm driving I'm like I'm like
buddy you know you want to hear one of my favorites you and he's like fine whatever sweep sweep the guy just sweep
him around you know like a broom you know just and and he's like that's it that's one of your favorites you know he's like laughing but you know it it
kind of came it's funny it came at the time Aron cricin I don't know if You' seen him play much but you know good
player he was at bitar's and I loved his game particularly his backand he would
just sweep guys left and right and I was
feeling anxious a lot before matches so I tried to simplify was sort of intuitively helping me to simplify how I
wanted to play now we could call it controlled aggression move the guy around build the point so sweeping
people is like I notice a lot of people hit down the middle neutral balls they don't need to you know sometimes it's
good to do you know cut the angle off but sweeping guys around means you know
or players around is moving them you know getting them out of the center um you know putting them them putting them
on defense and and really kind of controlling points dictating a little bit more yeah I've experienced this one
for sure this person wanted to know why do they play better when they watch good players play after they've watched good
players play something called mirror neurons when we watch people um we can
internalize we internalize what they're doing so it's sort of a naturally built in for empathy you know to be empathetic
and I wish more people were EMP athetic but you know empathy happens because we're mirroring you know and and it
helps us tune in so when we're watching highlevel what at tennis for example
there's that effect that can be happening so so I have huge mirror neurons I
actually you know my well my my um shall
say ex-wife um yeah my ex-wife now um she I'd be ordering and and I would pick
up the accent of the person who was asking for the order and I would speak
to her in that dialect because I I was
so because I'm naturally tuned into people and and it just is something I do now and it's um it's a it's a good thing
but it can also depending on who you surround yourself with maybe not be such a great thing so yeah uh this player
struggles to stay focused for all three sets what is your best advice or skill
for staying mentally locked in for that full two hours and three sets so
obviously for three hours it's a long time focus is going to go in and out
normal you want to catch your focus as early as you can and
refocus um and on changeovers really try to go blank and you know got the towel
use your towel feel the towel look up at a tree if you're outside or wherever you are look up at the air condition inside
whatever but like get your mind on something neutral it doesn't need you don't need to be thinking a lot unless
you need to make an adjustment you can you know what what's you're down 4-1 playing pretty well you need to adjust
your tactic probably so you want to ask yourself what's going on here it's usually probably playing too safe or
going for too much or or going to their strength maybe but um you know um I
think that you players need to kind of recover better and go neutral on changeovers and also between points is
huge you really need a routine between points breathing and I have a whole I
have routines that I teach people so anybody who wants to come to my website can get this Fearless tennis.com uh sign
up for my newsletter they'll get bunch of free stuff soon coming up too and but but yeah you know players need a routine
after the points that becomes automatic and that'll help immensely with Focus you mentioned Timothy way and kind of
being in the flow this person wanted to know how you can access that self- one
person versus the self two person more often well so that my understanding is
the self two is the yeah the reverse they had a reverse but yes go ahead okay yeah so
um it's a great question and Tim was on it early with this idea which
is um you know of course ch extremely challenging which is to sort of just
detangle yourself from your thoughts and not there's this so the the the one of
the biggest challenges we have is that we to get through the day every day we have to use our brain to solve problems
to fix to anticipate so our brain is a is a huge
strength um but it also in tennis in sports um can become a really big
weakness because we don't need to think the the way we do off the court it's a very different process you want to have
more visuals you want to have it be simple one word so all of that chatter
all of those instructions the self one saying you know don't do this and don't don't miss and you know it's 43d the
score the whole negotiation with the score it's you have to
practice recognizing being aware that you're having thoughts during the day
tune in notice it and refocus I have a technique I help I have people drop into
their feet you know just dropping their attention down centering or dropping into their feet you can't be focused on
two things at once so if you drop your attention into your body which we know
as mindfulness you're more present you're not thinking and you're letting your body do it so if you're willing to
let your mind get out of the way you can start releasing with self too you wrote
the book best tennis of your life and this person wanted to know how they could play their best tennis and relax
in tiebreakers so tiebreakers are an
interesting animal and we tend of course to get even more hyperfocused on the outcome and that we've buil think about
it we've spent all this time and now it it's just the weight of it right of course so there's more pressure and we
have to just I think work a little bit harder to play one point at a time to come back to those intentions to be
really clear about you know if if being consistent um you know got you to that
tiebreaker um you you want to stick with what worked to get you there you don't want to people tend to um Panic a little
bit get a little think they have to do more than they did before they as the
Finish Line is now in front of both players whoever reacts a little bit more calmly to that typically will do a
little better and I think that that's where Focus comes in you got to really drop in focus on the ball use your
breath have your routines so that's why the routines and such are important so you can come back to uh something you
have um confidence in and but I think you know matches are won a lot by being
solid and not giving away points building the point I think there's a lot of um value and um calmness that can
come with the idea of building the point you don't need to win it and one or two obviously at the highest level you kind
of do need to win it in two usually um uh you know first strike but um but you
really patience is important and and recognize the tendency to get swept into
the the score pressure and just playing one point at a time sticking to those intentions in the time I need you to
help me as a coach here because uh Bill bich had a quote and I love it it he
said something along the lines of before you learn how to win you need to learn how to not lose and he's like they won
all these football games in New England because they weren't fumbling and they weren't jumping off sides and they knew
the rules and he's like that was more important to him than how do I make the amazing catch or this amazing play let's
just get rid of all the stuff that loses but as a coach I found like I said that people view that in a negative term
and then they're really scared oh my God I just did this thing that I'm trying not to do as if it's a way there's a way
to eliminate it completely like what are your thoughts on communicating that concept and do you like that concept
yeah I mean I see his point and if you if you're you know in every level of the game you'll see that um if you watch
Challenger players 200 250 in the world and then you watch top 50 in the world
um certainly top 10 you you see fewer errors and um and they're more solid in
the big moments and being consistent statistically still wins a lot of
matches and so cleaning that up so you can then
build and build those weapons and feel good about those weapons you need that safety net you need that base that
Foundation that solid consistent you know Brad Gilbert destroyed people right
with his um competitiveness his consistency his intelligence not
everybody can can can can think the way he thinks per se you know and be
analytical like that but um but I think that um you do want to clean that up and
have that Foundation I want to make the point to while we're here that there's a
difference in all that we've been discussing there's a difference between being consistent and solid and playing
safe and scared to miss I want to make that distinction for sure and this is the
hardest question so buckle up you only get one no cheating what is your single
best advice for the 40
player actually if you want to give me two we have time for two if you if you have
to so the first would
be that four and that o that four.
o see if you could transcend that for two hours or the night before and can
you can you actually Orient to the game itself to the experience itself focus on
what matters to you what you've been practicing what you have confidence in with your patterns playing on more on
your terms be clear about that and and and try to move past the 40 4.2 4.5 3.82
three these numbers um will become irrelevant one
day but I mean um it's wonderful to have goals but
the putting people on a pedestal because they're a they they beat a 4o you know a good 40 versus a medium 40 like the the
ratings and the rankings and the score are obvious um obstacles that you need to
really um put to the side and come back to your index card
with your two intentions of how how do you want to play today what are what's important to you in addition to getting
the W and trying not to get the L like let's get past that and then the second
piece of advice would be that when you
miss it's okay and you don't need to analyze it
you don't need to analyze every time you miss I mean walk away from it walk away
from the train what you think's a train wreck is a b a little little bump in the
it's nothing it's nothing it's nothing you know if every pilot when they hit a little pocket of turbulence you know
freaked out and that plane I don't know if they keep it up as much as they do but just try to be more even keeled
emotionally so you're not going in your head upstairs in the attic trying to
solve for everything when you miss a forehand and half of them are probably
good misses anyway and your best tennis lies just beyond that forehand that you
would have just analyzed the crap out of your best tennis is right behind that if you allow it
