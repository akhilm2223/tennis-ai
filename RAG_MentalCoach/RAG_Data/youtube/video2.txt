MindStrong Sport

Intro
Novak jovic regarded as one of the goats
of tennis with 24 Grand Slam titles
while his physical and Technical ability
is world class so are many others at the
very top so what is it that sets him
apart from the rest when the big
occasions come and he can consistently
come out on top crushing his opponents
and it comes down to this one ingredient
in the recipe to Greatness his mental
strength his ability to handle the big
occasions setbacks even challenging
situations with what looks like relative
ease is what sets him apart from the
rest so was he born like this gifted
with this Godlike mental capability well
no early in his career he was regarded
as someone who would lose his call
temper and give up a little bit early
but something changed he unlocked this
capability that he had and allowed him
to make it to the very top consistently
breaking records and while allowing
everyone else to fall at the Wayside and
project himself to Legendary status but
what changed did he learn a new shot get
a new skill perhaps add extra physical
capabilities no and the clue lies in a
recent interview that he gave where he
had to stop a reporter mids sentence to
correct them when they were saying that
he was gifted with his mental strength
he corrected him to say that it's
something that I'm not gifted with I
work at it just as he would with any
part of his game whether that's a shot
skill or physical ability it's something
that he continuously works on well in

 What are Mental Skills
so what are mental skills mental skills
are quite simply skills that enable you
to regulate your thoughts emotions and
actions while performing at high level
sport is massively about the physical
and the technical the majority of it is
done in the mind and so mental skills
offer an opportunity for us to be able
to learn practice and even use certain
methods that can provide us certain
outcomes so whether that's better
performance on the field or even better
well-being off it think of these skills
as a part of your mental toolkit so that
when any situation arises whether that
be a challenge you can dig into that
mental tool kit and pull out the right
tool for the right job so let's get
straight into starting to build out your
mental toolkit with these five
fundamental mental skills first up is
 Goal Setting
goal setting Elite athletes are
constantly setting goals whether those
are long-term goals short-term goals
setting your goals gives you something
to form your motivation whether that's
setting in changes that you wish to make
or maybe even achievements that you wish
to obtain most athletes use a simple
system called smart goals where they set
out goals that are specific measurable
achievable relevant and time bound if
you're interested in goal setting I did
do another video on it so head over to
that video so that you can go into a
deeper dive on that subject athletes are
also very good at setting daily goals
when they set daily goals they set
targets that they want to achieve on a
regular whether that's going going and
doing a gym routine maybe attending a
training session or maybe even just
performing a habit goal setting is an
ongoing process it's something that you
regularly do you constantly keep fresh
because you should be working towards
your goals achieving them and setting
new ones as you go so that moves us on
to our mental skill number two which is
 Self Talk
selft talk you might see videos of
athletes talking to themselves just
before they're about to execute a
performance this can be anything from
psyching themselves up to maybe even
reminding them of the actions they're
about to execute in their skill and in a
podcast interview I did with Alexander
lajac on his research in selft talk he
describes selft talk as any verbal
 Self Talk Outcome
message directed at yourself and this
internal dialogue can be either our
greatest Ally friend coach or maybe even
our harshest critic it's also worth
noting that your selft talk doesn't have
to be positive either it's the outcome
of your self talk that matters most for
instance if you say to yourself I'm not
playing very well but then you start to
work harder in your performance and then
have better outcomes through working
harder that negative phrase that
negative selft talk had a positive
outcome you might also say something
like I'm feeling great and confident but
then you might start to take it easy and
not try as hard and that has a negative
outcome it's worth noting what your
content of your self talk is and the
outcome that it's creating and a simple
exercise that you can do is whether
you're at training or at a game use a
journal Notepad at the end to write down
some of the things that you were telling
yourself and also the performance that
you just gave so did you just put in a
bad performance and were you telling
yourself negative things or maybe
positive things or did you have a
positive performance and were you
telling yourself something that was
positive or maybe even negative that
allowed you to try harder it's worth
starting to understand what is it that
you're telling yourself and what is the
outcome that you're getting on to mental
 Visualization
skill number three visualization
visualiz ation or imagery is about
trying to create an image of the
performance before it's even happened I
personally have used visualization in my
professional career and found it really
effective I would use it on the night
before a match even on the day before a
game and almost moments before I was
about to execute my skills as something
that allowed me to see the performance
that I wanted to give it's about being
able to see the performance that you
want and know what you would do and plan
as such according to the actions the
skill sets that you have and know that
you've executed in training and not all
visualization has to be positive either
negative visualization can be just as
powerful pre-planning negative outcomes
allows us to not feel the shock of when
they do happen and can pre-plan the
response that we want against these
negative outcomes and situations so it
might be you miss a shot or you don't
execute the skill just how you wanted if
you can visualize that before it happens
you can start to think about what would
I do do if that is to occur and what
would that look like and then run
through that image that visualization of
what you would do and see yourself
acting it out when we can visualize both
the positive and the negative and know
what our plans and responses are going
to be our anxiety can reduce and we can
increase our confidence in the
performance that we're about to give and
this moves us on to our fourth
 Concentration
fundamental mental skill which is
concentration concentration is the
action of sustaining our attention on an
object task or activity
this can seem like one of the most
challenging skills for us to learn
because our Attention our concentration
is being pulled from Pillar To Post not
only in sport but in life as well with
many different distractions that we face
and these distractions that we can feel
could be anything from the environment
we're in our thoughts our moods what the
opposition in doing the crowd our
coaches and many different things that
are not in our control but athletes that
experience flow states are athletes that
are in fully immersed in a task and
they're experiencing High levels of
concentration so how do we get there
well it takes practice practicing
moments of intense concentration is what
I would call building our concentration
muscle the more times we practice having
deep concentration on something specific
and focused the more we teach our mind
to be able to do that skill and this
could take you from being that athlete
that loses their concentration misses
opportunities to one that zones in and
focuses in The crucial moments of their
Sport and so practices such as
meditation are great ways of you being
able to build your concentration whether
that's placing your attention and
in-depth concentration on something like
the breath maybe an object the space
around you the practice of meditation is
quite literally the training that you do
in order to improve your concentration
but sometimes all of that concentration
and in-depth focus is really challenging
to get if we don't have this last
fundamental mental skill which is
 Relaxation
relaxation when we are physically and
mentally tense as an athlete we don't
perform at our best we become disjointed
erratic and prone to making mistakes and
errors and sport is a high pressurized
environment we feel that anxiety and
that tension not only in our minds but
in our bodies you might see an athlete
shaking off their body just before
they're about to execute a crucial
moment in a game that's them releasing
that energy in their body letting go of
the tension and feeling much more
relaxed calmer so that they're clear on
what they're about to do or you might
see an take a deep breath just before
taking that crucial shot or executing a
Flawless routine and so learning
practices of relaxation not only allows
you to lower your anxiety and nerve
levels but we can start to think clearer
more precisely and execute what we want
when it matters most and we want to
perform at our best so if you're someone
who usually gets really nervous anxious
or tight before a performance relaxation
could be something for you and we do
this through meditation breathing EX
exercises yoga using progressive muscle
relaxation techniques that allows us to
not only slow down our bodies but also
our minds and when we can reduce that
level of anxiety we increase our chances
of bringing out a confident performance
