Tennis Mental Toughness TRAINING
Tennis Hacker

hey richard bryce here tennis hacker in
this video i want to talk to you about
mental toughness and how you can work on
yourself to become more mentally tough i
hope you find the video helpful if you
do be awesome if you give me a thumbs up
and if you haven't already done so
really appreciate it if you could
subscribe to my channel as well mental
toughness is one of the most important
parts of tennis and the key thing to
understand is that mental toughness is
kind of a skill or a set of skills that
you have to train yourself to get better
at people aren't born with it it's
something that you have to develop and
you have to work on we can break it down
in different ways so you can think about
kind of focus and concentration you can
think about decision making you could
think about your ability to stay
positive or you could think about your
ability to stay present so there's lots
of different components that could go
into mental toughness
but what i want to focus on this video
is how you actually train them
it's kind of thinking about them as a
skill and because it's a skill
you have to train them in a very
deliberate way just like you need to
train your strokes in a very deliberate
way if you go right i want to improve my
forehand and then you step on court and
you just go and play points and play
matches the chances of you improving
your forehand are slim to zero which is
why so many people don't improve their
forehand but you have to
take the same approach to improving your
mental toughness as you would do your
strokes you have to identify something
that you want to improve so with my
forehand i've identified that i want to
change the way i prepare or i've
identified whatever it is you then have
to go and focus on that for a number of
practice sessions and build it up over
time you have to do the same thing with
mental toughness as well so if you've
identified that you lose focus too often
then you have to very consciously and
deliberately go right i am going to
spend a period of time working on my
focus and working on my concentration
and that means that when you step out on
court for practice or you step out in
court for your matches or whatever it is
you're doing
then your intent is going to be to get
better at focusing so before the
practice session you set that intent
okay today i'm really working on my
focus this is the thing i'm going to
concentrate on anytime my mind starts to
wander i'm going to bring myself back to
what i should be thinking about and
again it might be thinking about a
specific coaching point but you have to
have that intention before you step on
court and then when you're practicing
when you're on court you have to be
aware of what you're doing you have to
make yourself aware of what you're doing
so if you're working with a coach or
you're working with a practice partner
whatever you're working on your idealist
or your your goal is to try and be as
focused as possible if you kind of
realize your mind's wandering and you're
thinking about your work or you're
worrying about a situation at home or
you're thinking about something else you
have to bring yourself back you have to
catch yourself and you have to bring you
know bring your mind back to what you're
focusing and you're meant to be doing
and this is called deliberate practice
or deep and deliberate practice and the
way this works is
you're not going to get it perfect every
time if you were able to do something
perfect every time then you don't need
to practice it and learn it anymore
you're intentionally going to be doing
something that's hard for you to do so
if losing focus is something you do a
lot
it's going to take time for you to
improve it you have to be okay that
there's mistakes there will be times
that you lose focus but literally the
whole goal the whole thing that you're
working on is recognizing it trying to
bring yourself back and trying to
improve it it could be the same for
positive self-talk if you realize you're
the sort of person that gets really
negative and you know you miss shots you
go
richard you suck man you're a piece of
expletive and you know that that's
something you do obviously that is not
going to help your tennis it's something
you have to work on getting rid of you
have to stay more positive that's part
of being more mentally tough so you have
to set that intent before you step on
court and then when you're on court you
have to practice you have to consciously
be aware of when you start to say
negative things to yourself and you have
to replace them with positive things
same thing for decision making if you
know that you make silly shots and you
go down the line too soon off a shot
that you've got no business you have to
have the intent of improving your shot
selection you have to have the intent of
being more disciplined within rallies
and then you have to go out and you have
to practice and you have to work on it
and that's the way that improving mental
toughness works everything is a skill
everything is trainable
the more you allow yourself to do
something badly
the better you get at doing it badly or
in other words the worse you get at it
the more you practice doing something
well the better that you're going to get
at it you don't suddenly go from being
you know really weak in an area to being
amazingly strong it takes time it's
gradual you have to work on it but if
you put the effort in you can change
your mental toughness and that's going
to make a massive difference in the way
that you can play
now i've got a master class where i go
in a lot deeper about this it's going to
give you some specific strategies to
work on different things it's also going
to talk about some of the things that
can hold you back in terms of mental
toughness because yes you want to work
on the skill but often there can be
things going on within your body that
make it a lot harder to be mentally
tough so i'll be talking about those in
the master class as well so i'll place
the link down in the description and
i'll place a link up there so you can
